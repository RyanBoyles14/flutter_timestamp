# flutter_timestamp

A Flutter timestamp application, as part of my interview for Ansync Labs

Currently, the app allows the user to create a timestamp and to sync the time to their device's current time.
Every timestamp created is saved to a scrollable list. The user can select whatever timestamp in the list to display on screen.
